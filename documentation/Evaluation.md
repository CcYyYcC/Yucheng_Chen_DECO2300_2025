# Evaluation and Iteration

The evaluation of Prototype 1 provided valuable insights into both usability strengths and areas for improvement. Across all five participants, task completion was consistently successful, with a 100% success rate. Core interactions such as zooming, repositioning the canvas, and using pen and eraser tools were rated highly, often described as smooth, intuitive, and natural. This suggests that simulating XR interactions with mouse and keyboard already provides a strong foundation for future VR implementations. Satisfaction ratings averaged 4.4/5, with three participants giving 5/5 and two rating 4/5, indicating that the prototype met its primary usability goals.

However, some issues emerged. Reset functionality, while effective, was frequently described as abrupt or mechanical. Several participants suggested smoother animations, clearer visual indicators, or boundaries around the canvas to prevent it from disappearing. Others noted the need for a visible shortcut guide or on-screen instructions to support first-time users. Tool switching was generally functional but could benefit from faster feedback and subtle cues such as sound or vibration. One participant also highlighted the risk of accidental clearing, suggesting a confirmation step to prevent unintentional loss of work. These findings indicate that while the prototype works reliably, improvements in feedback and error prevention would significantly enhance user confidence and immersion.

Participants also reflected on future XR interface preferences. Three preferred a finger-based menu for its immersive and natural feel, while two favored a wrist menu for structured tool access. This split highlights the importance of testing both approaches in later iterations to identify which supports different drawing workflows more effectively. Improvement suggestions such as supporting pen tilt for line variation, adjustable brush sizes, and interactive effects point towards features that could make the experience feel more like physical drawing.

Moving forward, iteration will focus on several directions. The next version should implement full layer editing, as this is critical for any drawing application. Development of a functional wrist menu will allow comparison against the finger menu concept, while also reducing reliance on the current canvas menu. UI enhancements, more polished interface design, and interactive effects will improve visual appeal and immersion. Finally, enabling scene switching will provide users with a more customizable creative environment. Together, these improvements will ensure the prototype evolves into a richer and more authentic XR drawing experience.
