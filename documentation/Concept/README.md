# Assessment 1.1: DESIGN REPORT Concept

## Project Name
**Procreate XR – Immersive Creation in Mixed Reality**

## Category
Creation / Productivity

## 1. Application Redesign & User Task Identification
Procreate is a widely used digital illustration and painting tool for touchscreen tablets. While powerful in its 2D form, it confines artists to a flat workspace.  
This XR redesign reimagines Procreate as an immersive mixed reality environment where the canvas, tools, and layers exist in three-dimensional space.  
The XR format supports richer spatial interaction, ergonomic flexibility, and a greater sense of immersion than traditional interfaces, making it ideal for creative workflows.

## 2. Tasks and Goals
The redesigned application supports three core user goals:

- **Spatial Art Creation & Editing**  
  Artists can work on a floating virtual canvas and adjust tools through wrist-mounted menus.

- **Spatial Management of Layers & Tools**  
  Layers and tools are presented as floating panels that can be rearranged, merged, or hidden using natural gestures to improve workflow organisation.

- **Flexible Canvas Positioning**  
  Users can reposition and scale the canvas to suit any working posture—standing, sitting, or reclining—enhancing ergonomic comfort and creative flexibility.

## 3. Iteration and Refinement
- **Week 2 Low-Fidelity Prototype**  
  Created using cardboard and paper to explore spatial interactions.  
  Floating canvas placed in front of the user.  
  - Left hand: global functions (export, settings)  
  - Right hand: creative tools (brush, eraser, layers)  

- **Tested Interactions**  
  - Pinch-to-zoom  
  - Grab-and-drag to reposition canvas  
  - Raise hand to activate radial menu  

- **Findings**  
  Participants liked the separation of functions and found gestures natural.  
  Improvements needed: clearer visual feedback when menus are active, and more stable anchoring of menus to the hand or gaze.

## 4. XR Environment and Interactions
- **Modes**  
  - **Augmented Reality:** Canvas appears in the real world  
  - **Virtual Studio:** Immersive focus environment  

- **Core Interactions**  
  - Pinch with both hands to zoom  
  - Grab-and-drag to move the canvas  
  - Wrist-anchored radial menus (global tools left, creative tools right)  
  - Raise wrist to open menu, tap or slide to select tools  
  - Floating cards for layer management (rearrange, merge, hide)  
  - Gesture or voice commands for quick actions (Undo, New Layer)

---

## 5. Initial Testing Plan
**Objectives:**  
- Assess intuitiveness and efficiency of gesture-based canvas control, wrist menu navigation, and spatial layer management.

**Assumptions:**  
- Gestures feel more natural than controllers.  
- Splitting functions between hands reduces confusion.  
- Visual feedback improves usability.

**Methods:**  
- Updated low-fidelity prototypes with visual cues  
- Mid-fidelity XR simulations  
- Data collection:  
  - Task completion time  
  - Gesture accuracy  
  - Satisfaction ratings  
  - Post-task interviews for qualitative insights

**Expected Outcome:**  
- Validate smoother creative workflow  
- Guide improvements to menu feedback and onboarding
