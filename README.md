# Week 1 Activity Log â€“ XR App Concept Development
 
## Project Title
XR Extension of Procreate

## Overview
In Week 1, I explored XR applications that support active user interactions. Based on the lecture guidelines, I selected Procreate as the app to redesign for XR. The focus is on creating a mixed reality version of Procreate using gesture, eye tracking, and voice control.

## Activities
- Reviewed Lecture 1 criteria and selected a productivity-focused app  
- Chose Procreate for its strong creative toolset and potential for XR extension  
- Developed an initial idea of drawing in real space using hand and eye interactions  
- Defined three main user tasks:  
  1. Draw and paint in space or on physical surfaces  
  2. Manage layers and tools using spatial controls  
  3. Switch between AR and VR modes for different workflows  
- Mapped core XR interactions: gesture-based control, eye tracking for selection, voice commands for quick actions

## Reflection
This week helped clarify the difference between passive VR experiences and active XR interaction. Procreate was chosen as a strong starting point for developing an immersive and productive creative tool in extended reality.
